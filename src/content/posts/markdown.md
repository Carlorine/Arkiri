> 这是上游模板留下的英文样本。定义列表、行块、Pandoc 表格，以及把 `---` / `...` 自动换成破折号和省略号，都不会按下文旧说明生效。当前会渲染的语法见[兼容性核对](/posts/markdown-compatibility/)和[内容与格式全览](/posts/content-format-guide/)。

# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

- this one
- that one
- the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Three dashes inside a sentence stay as `---`. `...` is not rewritten as an ellipsis; type the glyph you want. Unicode is supported. ☺

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

```
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
```

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```

### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

1. First, get these ingredients:

    - carrots
    - celery
    - lentils

2. Boil some water.

3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Footnote text goes here.

Pandoc grid tables are not rendered. Use a GFM table instead:

| size | material | color |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 9 | leather | brown |
| 10 | hemp canvas | natural |
| 11 | glass | transparent |

A horizontal rule follows.

Definition lists and line blocks are Pandoc syntax. They stay ordinary paragraphs and lines here:

```markdown
apples
: Good for making applesauce.

| Line one
| Line too
```

and images can be specified like so:

[//]: # (![example image]&#40;./demo-banner.png "An exemplary image"&#41;)

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\pi
=3.1415926535
 \;8979323846\;2643383279\;5028841971\;6939937510\;5820974944
 \;5923078164\;0628620899\;8628034825\;3421170679\;\ldots
\end{equation*}
$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
